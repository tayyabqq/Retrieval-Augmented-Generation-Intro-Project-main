This project is a RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)-based system developed to enhance the performance of question answering tasks by combining the power of document retrieval and language generation.

The system first retrieves relevant context documents from a given knowledge base using techniques like vector similarity search, and then passes this context to a language model (LLM) to generate more accurate and contextual answers.
